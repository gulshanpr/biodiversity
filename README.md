This is a campaign website designed to help people who are working on or need help organizing activities or awareness campaigns. Through smart contracts, people can participate and help improve the nature and heritage sites. The community will reward them with:

- Collectible NFTs that are limited to that campaign only.
- Carbon credit points for reducing carbon emissions.
- The ability to exchange these points for handcrafted goods that support the Vocal for Local and Make in India schemes.
- The opportunity for locals to sell their region's art and crafts to a wider audience.
